# Plot PCA loadings

Generates a plot of PCA loadings, illustrating the contribution of
features to each principal component. This function can be used to
investigate which feature (groups) are contributing to the variance seen
in the plot and which need further investigation.

## Usage

``` r
plot_pca_loading(
  data = NULL,
  variable,
  qc_types = NA,
  pca_dims = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
  log_transform = TRUE,
  top_n = 30,
  vertical_bars = FALSE,
  abs_loading = TRUE,
  filter_data = FALSE,
  include_qualifier = FALSE,
  include_istd = FALSE,
  include_feature_filter = NA,
  exclude_feature_filter = NA,
  min_median_value = NA,
  font_base_size = 8
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A `MRMhubExperiment` object.

- variable:

  A character string indicating the variable to use for PCA analysis.
  Must be one of: "area", "height", "intensity", "norm_intensity",
  "response", "conc", "conc_raw", "rt", "fwhm".

- qc_types:

  A character vector specifying the QC types to plot. It must contain at
  least one element. The default `NA` plots any of the non-blank QC
  types ("SPL", "TQC", "BQC", "HQC", "MQC", "LQC", "NIST", "LTR")
  present in the dataset.

- pca_dims:

  A numeric vector indicating for which PCA dimensions to the loadings
  should be shown. Default is c(1, 2, 3, 4).

- log_transform:

  A logical value indicating whether to log-transform the data before
  the PCA. Default is `TRUE`.

- top_n:

  Number of top features with highest absolute loading that will be to
  shown for each PC dimension. Default is 30.

- vertical_bars:

  Show vertical bars instead of horizontal bars in the plot. Default is
  `FALSE`.

- abs_loading:

  Show absolute loading values instead of signed loadings. Default is
  `TRUE`.

- filter_data:

  A logical value indicating whether to use all data (default) or only
  QC-filtered data (filtered via
  [`filter_features_qc()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/filter_features_qc.md)).

- include_qualifier:

  A logical value indicating whether to include qualifier features.
  Default is `TRUE`.

- include_istd:

  A logical value indicating whether to include internal standard (ISTD)
  features. Default is `TRUE`.

- include_feature_filter:

  A regex pattern or a vector of feature names used to filter features
  by `feature_id`. If `NA` or an empty string (`""`) is provided, the
  filter is ignored. When a vector of length \> 1 is supplied, only
  features with exactly these names are selected (applied individually
  as OR conditions).

- exclude_feature_filter:

  A regex pattern or a vector of feature names used to exclude features
  by `feature_id`. If `NA` or an empty string (`""`) is provided, the
  filter is ignored. When a vector of length \> 1 is supplied, only
  features with exactly these names are excluded (applied individually
  as OR conditions).

- min_median_value:

  Minimum median feature value across the selected QC-type samples
  required for a feature to be included. `NA` (default) applies no
  filtering. This is a fast way to exclude noisy features; for
  principled QC-based filtering use
  [`filter_features_qc()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/filter_features_qc.md).

- font_base_size:

  Numeric. Base font size (in points) for plot text. Default is 8.

## Value

A `ggplot` object with PCA loadings plot
